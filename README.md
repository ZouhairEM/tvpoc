# TV App POC

App fetching TV show data from the [TVMaze API](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows) with which you can filter and sort through.  

## Architectural decisions

The reason this application is developed with the technology that was decided on is because I wanted it be as close to what I know to be the tech stack used within FED at ABN AMRO as I was able to build given the constraint. That’s why Vue.JS 3 was decided on as the main JS framework, Bootstrap for its UI library and Vue Utils for some Unit Testing.__

In terms of setting up, the application is made to be as dynamic as possible with little to no hardcoded values.

### Instructions

Running the application is relatively straightforward. Upon copying the code, use **npm install** to install dependencies, followed by **npm run serve** in your CLI to run the application on your local machine. You can also take a look at the [Github repo](https://github.com/ZouhairEM/tvpoc) to see information about the version history that went into development.

### Final thoughts

Working on this project was a lot of fun, regardless of any outcome. My only regret is not having written more Unit Tests. This was simply too hard to achieve considering I could only and mostly work on this POC after working hours.
