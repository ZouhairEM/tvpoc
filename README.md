# TV App POC

App fetching TV show data from the [TVMaze API](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows) with which you can filter and sort through.  

## Architectural decisions

The reason this application is developed with the technology that was decided on is because I wanted it be as close to what I know to be the tech stack used within FED at ABN AMRO as I was able to build given the constraint. Thatâ€™s why Vue.JS 3 was decided on as the main JS framework, Bootstrap for its UI library and Vue Utils for some Unit Testing. In terms of setting up, the application is made to be as dynamic as possible with few to no hardcoded values.

### Instructions

Running the application is relatively straightforward. After copying the code, use **npm install** to install dependencies, followed by **npm run serve** in your CLI to run the application on your local machine. To run and see the unit tests, use **npm run test:unit components**. You can also take a look at the [Github repo](https://github.com/ZouhairEM/tvpoc) to see information about the version history that went into development.

### Final thoughts

Working on this project was a lot of fun, regardless of any outcome. My only regret is not having written more Unit Tests. This was simply too hard to achieve considering I could only and mostly work on this POC after working hours.
