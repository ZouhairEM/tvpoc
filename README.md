# TV App POC

App fetching TV show data from the [TVMaze API](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows) with which you can filter and sort through.  

## Architectural decisions

The reason this application is developed with the technology that was decided on is because I wanted it be as close to what I know to be the tech stack is used within FED at ABN AMRO, as that I could make it given the time constraint. Thatâ€™s why Vue.JS 3 was decided on as the main JS framework, Bootstrap for its UI system and Jest + Vue Utils for Unit Testing.

### Instructions

Use **npm run serve** in your CLI to run this application on your local machine or **npm run build** to run a build. You can take a look at the [Github repo](https://github.com/ZouhairEM/tvpoc) to see information about the version history that went into its development.
